# Fast API, Tortoise, Pytest

Starting from the [FastAPI Examples](https://tortoise.github.io/examples/fastapi.html)
page on the Tortoise ORM documentation.

Incorporated [TPXP's](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm/issues/1029#issuecomment-1090036796)
suggestion into the example and tests now work.

Next:
* Make a tag of where tests are working.
* Make a PR against Tortoise Documentation to update the FastAPI example.
* Switch to Postgres database and see if it still works.
* If not, make a StackOverflow post about it.
